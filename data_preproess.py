    You are now operating in Executable Language Grounding mode. Your goal is to help users accomplish tasks by suggesting executable actions that best fit their needs and give a score. Your skill set includes both basic and custom actions:

    1. Basic Actions
    Basic actions are standardized and available across all platforms. They provide essential functionality and are defined with a specific format, ensuring consistency and reliability. 
    Basic Action 1: CLICK 
        - purpose: Click at the specified position.
        - format: CLICK <point>[[x-axis, y-axis]]</point>
        - example usage: CLICK <point>[[101, 872]]</point>

    Basic Action 2: TYPE
        - purpose: Enter specified text at the designated location.
        - format: TYPE [input text]
        - example usage: TYPE [Shanghai shopping mall]

    Basic Action 3: SCROLL
        - Purpose: SCROLL in the specified direction.
        - Format: SCROLL [direction (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)]
        - Example Usage: SCROLL [UP]

    2. Custom Actions
    Custom actions are unique to each user's platform and environment. They allow for flexibility and adaptability, enabling the model to support new and unseen actions defined by users. These actions extend the functionality of the basic set, making the model more versatile and capable of handling specific tasks.

    Custom Action 1: PRESS_BACK
        - purpose: Press a back button to navigate to the previous screen.
        - format: PRESS_BACK
        - example usage: PRESS_BACK

    Custom Action 2: PRESS_HOME
        - purpose: Press a home button to navigate to the home page.
        - format: PRESS_HOME
        - example usage: PRESS_HOME

    Custom Action 3: ENTER
        - purpose: Press the enter button.
        - format: ENTER
        - example usage: ENTER

    Custom Action 4: IMPOSSIBLE
        - purpose: Indicate the task is impossible.
        - format: IMPOSSIBLE
        - example usage: IMPOSSIBLE

    In most cases, task instructions are high-level and abstract. Carefully read the instruction and action history, then perform reasoning to determine the most appropriate next action.

    And I hope you evaluate your action to be scored, giving it a score from 1 to 5. 
    A higher score indicates that you believe this action is more likely to accomplish the current goal for the given screenshot.
    1 means you believe this action definitely cannot achieve the goal.
    2 means you believe this action is very unlikely to achieve the goal.
    3 means you believe this action has a certain chance of achieving the goal.
    4 means you believe this action is very likely to achieve the goal.
    5 means you believe this action will definitely achieve the goal.

    And your final goal, current goal, previous actions, previous actions and associated screenshot are as follows:
    Final goal: {task}
    current goal: {current_goal}
    previous actions: {previous_actions}
    step list:{step_lists}
    screenshot:<image>
    Your output must strictly follow the format below, and especially avoid using unnecessary quotation marks or other punctuation marks.(where osatlas action must be one of the action formats I provided and score must be 1 to 5):
    action:
    score: 
    """

    score = item.get("score", "")
    action = item.get("osatlas_action", "")

    preprocessed_item = {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": prompt_text,
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": f"action: {action}\nscore: {score}",
            }
        ],
        "images":[image_path]
    }
    preprocessed_data.append(preprocessed_item)

    json.dump(preprocessed_data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
